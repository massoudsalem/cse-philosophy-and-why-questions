# CSE philosophy and why questions
#### This repo contains resources to answer philosophical questions about "Why it has been done that way?" in Computer science and engineering [The philosophy of science], also the question of "What to do?"

## Another why?


As an undergraduate, I was always wondering "why" in computer science. Why are languages designed this way? Why choose this architecture over that? Why does this algorithm work? Unfortunately, most CS degrees lack courses exploring the philosophy behind the field. I discovered those deeper foundations later, fueling a passion to share that knowledge.
This repository collects resources illuminating the "why" of software and systems. I hope it fosters new ways of seeing for future engineers."CSE Philosophy and Why Questions" gathers courses, books, papers and talks from experts. It aims to expand horizons on fundamental questions like:Why this approach? What principles drive design choices? How can new perspectives transform old problems?Question assumptions. Envision new possibilities. Find purpose and grow as thinkers, builders and members of this craft.Discover truth. Build meaning. Thrive in purpose.Together, let's spark contemplation and cultivate growth. Deepen discussions shaping technology and its role in the world.Inspire reflection. Find meaning in challenges faced and truths unveiled.Thrive as engineers. See with fresh eyes. Understand anew.
